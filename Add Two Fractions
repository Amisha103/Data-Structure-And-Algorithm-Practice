Problem statement
Youâ€™re given two fractions, a/b, and c/d. Your task is to add these two fractions and print this answer in the simplest form.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10 ^ 4
1 <= a,b,c,d <= 10 ^ 9
Time Limit: 1 sec

 Where 'T' denotes the number of test cases, 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' denote the integers given as input in the problem.
Sample Input 1 :
1
5 7 4 9
Sample Output 1 :
73 63
Explanation of Sample Input 1 :
Sum of 5/7 + 4/9 = 73/63, which is already in its simplest form because we cannot reduce it further.
Sample Input 2 :
1
1 500 2 1500
Sample Output 2 :
1 300
Explanation of Sample Input 2 :
Sum of 1/500 + 2/1500 = 5/1500, which after reducing in simplest form becomes 1/300.

        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
