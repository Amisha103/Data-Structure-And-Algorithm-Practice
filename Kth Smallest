Given an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than the size of the array, your task is to find the kth smallest element in the given array.

Follow up: Don't solve it using the inbuilt sort function.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: 3rd smallest element in the given array is 7.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 20, 15], k = 4 
Output: 15
Explanation: 4th smallest element in the given array is 15.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size <= 106
1<= arr[i] <= 106
1 <= k <= n


Solution-

class Solution {
    public static int kthSmallest(int[] arr, int k) {
        // Your code here
        TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
        int n = arr.length;
        for(int i = 0;i < n;i++)
        {
            set.add(arr[i]);
        }
        int cnt = 0;
        Integer ans = 0;
        while(cnt < k)
        {
            ans = set.pollFirst();
            cnt++;
        }
        int ans1 = ans;
       return ans1; 
    }
}
