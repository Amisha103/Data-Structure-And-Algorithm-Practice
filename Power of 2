Power of 2
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 32.58%Submissions: 403K+Points: 2
Given a non-negative integer n. The task is to check if it is a power of 2. 

Examples

Input: n = 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 is equal to 2 raised to 3 (23 = 8).
Input: n = 98
Output: false
Explanation: 98 cannot be obtained by any power of 2.
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: (20 = 1).
Expected Time Complexity: O(log n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
0 ≤ n < 1020

Solution-
class Solution {

    // Function to check if given number n is a power of two.
    public static boolean isPowerofTwo(long n) {

long low = 0l;
long high = n;
while(low <= high)
{
    long mid = (low + high) / 2;
    long num = (long)Math.pow(2, mid);
    if(num == n)
    {
        return true;
    }
    else if(num < n)
    {
        low = mid + 1;
    }
    else
    {
        high = mid - 1;
    }
    
}
return false;
        
    }
   
}
